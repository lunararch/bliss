Guide to Building a Neuro-sama-like Personal Assistant in Python
This guide outlines how to create a conversational AI with a customizable personality, conversation memory, and a user-friendly interface, inspired by Neuro-sama. The assistant will be built in Python, using Streamlit for the interface, Ollama for NLP, and the file structure you’ve defined under the BLISS directory.
Prerequisites

Python Knowledge: Familiarity with Python programming (variables, functions, libraries).
Hardware: A computer with at least 8GB RAM (16GB+ recommended for larger models).
Internet Access: To download libraries and Ollama models.
Ollama Installation: Install Ollama (https://ollama.ai) to run local LLMs.

Tools and Libraries

Python 3.8+: Core programming language.
Ollama: For running local LLMs like LLaMA or Mistral.
Streamlit: For creating a web-based chat interface.
SQLite: For storing conversation history (included with Python).
Optional:
SpeechRecognition: For voice input.
pyttsx3: For text-to-speech output.



Install these with:
pip install streamlit sqlite3 speechrecognition pyttsx3

Install Ollama by following instructions at https://ollama.ai/download.

Step-by-Step Guide
1. Set Up Your Environment

Install Python 3.8 or higher and Ollama.

Create a virtual environment in the BLISS directory:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate


Install required libraries.

Pull an Ollama model (e.g., llama3):
ollama pull llama3



2. Initialize a Database for Conversation Memory

In BLISS/core/memory.py, use SQLite to create BLISS/data/memory.db for storing conversation history.
Define functions to:
Initialize a table with columns for user input, assistant response, and timestamp.
Save and retrieve conversation history.



3. Define the Assistant’s Personality

In BLISS/core/personality.py, create a function to load personality data from BLISS/data/personalities/.
Define traits in a JSON file (e.g., personalities/default.json):
Name (e.g., "Ami")
Tone (e.g., "friendly, witty")
Interests (e.g., ["gaming", "anime"])
Default greeting


Use these traits to shape prompts for the Ollama model.

4. Set Up the NLP Model

In BLISS/core/ai_client.py, write a function to interact with the Ollama model using its API or Python client (ollama package).
Pass user input and conversation context to the model, incorporating personality traits in the prompt.
Example: Use ollama.chat with a model like llama3.

5. Implement Conversation Memory

In BLISS/core/memory.py, create functions to:
Save user inputs and assistant responses to BLISS/data/memory.db.
Retrieve the last 3–5 conversation turns for context.


Pass context to the Ollama model via BLISS/core/ai_client.py.

6. Build the Streamlit Interface

In BLISS/web/components/app.py, create a Streamlit app:

Display a text input box for user messages.
Show conversation history in a chat-like format.
Use Streamlit’s session state to update the chat dynamically.


Integrate functions from BLISS/core/ai_client.py and BLISS/core/memory.py.

Run the app from BLISS/web with:
streamlit run components/app.py



7. (Optional) Add Voice Interaction

In BLISS/voice/speech_to_text.py, use SpeechRecognition for speech-to-text.
In BLISS/voice/text_to_speech.py, use pyttsx3 for text-to-speech.
Integrate these into BLISS/web/components/app.py with Streamlit buttons.

8. Test and Refine

Run the Streamlit app and test conversations.
Verify personality consistency and context retention.
Adjust prompts or model parameters in BLISS/core/ai_client.py if needed.
Test edge cases (e.g., long inputs, ambiguous queries).

9. (Optional) Enhance with Visuals

Add a static avatar image in BLISS/web/components/app.py.
Use BLISS/utils/helpers.py for basic animation logic with Pygame in a separate window.
For a Neuro-sama-like animated character, explore VTube Studio integration.

Tips for Success

Model Selection: Start with llama3 in Ollama; upgrade for better quality if needed.
Prompt Engineering: Craft prompts in BLISS/core/ai_client.py to enforce personality.
Performance: Run Ollama on a GPU for faster responses.
Safety: Add filters in BLISS/utils/helpers.py for appropriate responses.

Next Steps

Fine-Tuning: Fine-tune an Ollama-compatible model on custom dialogue data.
Cloud Deployment: Host the app on Streamlit Cloud, running Ollama locally or on a server.
Advanced Features: Add mood detection or external API integrations in BLISS/core/bliss.py.
